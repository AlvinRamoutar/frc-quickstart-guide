        <p><strong><a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics</a></strong> is at its core, a
            program given birth to by the outstanding team at FIRST, whose mission
            involves empowering youth <strong>For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.</strong> Today,
            it has grown to
            much more. FRC and other FIRST programs are shaping communities, putting technology into the hands of
            unprivileged youth and challenging minds across the world to become more than just a 'user' of technology,
            but rather an innovator.</p>

        <p>True to its namesake, FIRST promotes these values through competitions, the FIRST Robotics Competition
            (FRC). FRC is an event, a sport where robots are the players, working together with their alliance against
            opponents to achieve specific objectives identified in the annual challenge.</p>

        <p>Ironically, the challenge involves teams building Robots. Luckily, FIRST has prepared specialized kits
            for teams which help accelerate their build process. Along this equipment is a
            <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/kit-of-parts">lot of cool stuff</a>
            provided on behalf of FIRST sponsors. A key set of this equipment provided would be the
            <strong>FRC Control System Hardware</strong> - both expensive and daunting at first.</p>

        <p>
            This guide strives to give a brief overview of several main control system elements for the <strong>FRC 2018
            control
            system.</strong> Unlike documentation for these components, I will try to go into detail where each of these
            components fit into the 'grand scheme' that is your robotic system. Hence, expect some practical tips around
            the technicalities, electrical (wiring), and possibly code.

        <h2>NI RoboRIO</h2>
        <img src="images/am-3000-2.jpg">
        <p class="wpilibSummary">
            The NI-roboRIO is the main robot controller used for FRC. The roboRIO includes a dual-core ARM Cortexâ„¢-A9
            processor and FPGA which runs both trusted elements for control and safety as well as team-generated code.
            Integrated controller I/O includes a variety of communication protocols (Ethernet, USB, CAN, SPI, I2C, and
            serial) as well as PWM, servo, digital I/O, and analog I/O channels used to connect to robot peripherals for
            sensing and control. The roboRIO should connect to the dedicated 12V port on the Power Distribution Panel
            for power. Wired communication is available via USB or Ethernet.
        </p>
        <p>
            The grand, flat, and all-powerful brain of your robot; roboRIO. Meant to be the successor to the compact RIO
            (cRIO), the roboRIO is even more compact at a form factor of around 15cm x 15cm x 3cm.
            The best analogy for the roboRIO would be a tricked-out Arduino. Both are microcontroller units, with the
            roboRIO supporting much more functionality, such as on-board Ethernet and some useful safety features (e.g.
            Brownout behavior).

                <li><strong>Digital Input and Output (DIO) connectors</strong><br>
                    Handles digital input (HIGH or LOW signals). Used primary for interfacing sensors to your
                    robotic system, ideal for switches (e.g. Limit Switches).
                    Teams often make the mistake of using DIO to drive motors or other devices. This is NOT the
                    intention of the DIO rail, and doing so WILL DAMAGE your roboRIO. DIO outputs a sinking/sourcing
                    current of 4mA, meant solemnly for digital signals, and not for powering devices. If you need to
                    power devices, either pull from the PDP, or the VRM.

                    <strong>I2C</strong><br>
                    Used for serial communication. I've seen teams use this for Arduino/roboRIO interfacing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>CAN Port</strong><br>
                    Stands for Controller Area Network, allows for devices (often, microcontrollers) to communicate
                    with each other without a host machine. This bus is used to connect your roboRIO to your PCM,
                    and your PCM to your PDP, giving them the ability to communicate with each other.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Power Connector</strong><br>
                    Connects over to the PDP, VIN for the roboRIO. Rated at 7-16V at 45W max.

                    <strong>Ethernet Port</strong><br>
                    Connects the roboRIO to a network. Assigned an address by your robot radio (router). If there was a
                    problem doing so, the RIO will have an auto configured IP.

                <li>
                    <strong>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Port</strong><br>
                    Used for serial communication with peripherals, such as complex sensors (e.g. Gyro).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Status LEDs</strong><br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Connectors</strong><br>
                    Used to communicate with speed controllers and other PWM driven systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>myRIO Expansion Port (MXP)</strong><br>
                    Used to connect with breakout boards and custom circuits/systems. Essentially, if you want to create
                    a custom 'attachment' or device that interfaces directly with the roboRIO.
                    Teams often use this port for custom breadboard circuits, such as a custom LED light show.
                    Be careful with how you use XMP; it is important that all systems are controlled BY the roboRIO at
                    all times. Your XMP use will be inspected!

                    RESET restarts the roboRIO processor and FPGA. Similar to the reset button on an Arduino. USER
                    button produces a logical FALSE while pressed, and TRUE otherwise. Often used for debugging as a

            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The roboRIO will have a plethora of wires situated around it, since most components of your robotic
                    system will in one way or another interface with it. For this reason, it is recommended that the
                    roboRIO be the central component to your control system board with ample space between itself, and
                    other components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The roboRIO module should be physically protected - unless if you want to dish out another $1000 for
                    it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The roboRIO should be easily accessible; especially during the competition. Make the lives of those
                    in your pit easier!
                </li>
                <li>
                    The recommended mounting technique for the roboRIO is zip ties on the bottom, through the mounting
                    spots on the roboRIO, and through your control system board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For optimal operation, use a fully charged battery (especially before a match!). A low battery is
                    asking for brownout when you need your bot the most. I highly recommend you check out the 'Brownout
                    Behavior' section of the roboRIO User Manual.

        <p class="wpilibSummary">
            The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) is designed to distribute power from a 12VDC battery to various robot
            components through auto-resetting circuit breakers and a small number of special function fused connections.
            The PDP provides 8 output pairs rated for 40A continuous current and 8 pairs rated for 30A continuous
            current. The PDP provides dedicated 12V connectors for the roboRIO, as well as connectors for the Voltage
            Regulator Module and Pneumatics Control Module. It also includes a CAN interface for logging current,
            temperature, and battery voltage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most systems requiring power are to be connected to the PDP. The PDP is more than just a power distributor;
            it's also an intelligent circuit breaker.

                    When mounting, I recommend leaving ample space for the power rails to accommodate for heavy gauge
                    wiring, as well as have the battery terminal mount facing outwards from your main control (mounting)
                    board. This will ensure the 6 AWG wire for the battery will interfere the least with other
                    wiring/component placements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To fasten, the PDP has holes on each corner. A bolt and nut would suffice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is recommended that the PDP be the final node in your CAN chain, since it has a terminating
                    resistor. As such, your wiring will be as follows: roboRIO > PCM > PDP

        <h2>Pneumatics Control Module (PCM)</h2>
        <img src="images/217-4243.jpg">
        <p class="wpilibSummary">
            The PCM is a device that contains all of the inputs and outputs required to operate 12V or 24V pneumatic
            solenoids and the on board compressor. The PCM is enabled/disabled by the roboRIO over the CAN interface.
            The PCM contains an input for the pressure sensor and will control the compressor automatically when the
            robot is enabled and a solenoid has been created in the code. The device also collects diagnostic
            information such as solenoid states, pressure switch state, and compressor state. The module includes
            diagnostic LEDâ€™s for both CAN and the individual solenoid channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on its use, the pneumatics system tends to be one of the most powerful, simple, and dangerous. On
            the surface, there isn't much to it; compressed air is pumped into a piston, forcing its expansion. However,
            unlike speed controllers which burn out in a stroke of heat and fit of smoke, invalid pneumatic systems
            explode. In FRC, ample resources have been provided for setting up the pneumatics system, along with
            regulatory equipment.
            <br>
            Unlike other modules in your robotic system, the PCM is optional, only needed if there is some form of
            pneumatic system on board.

                <li>
                    As an aside, the air compressor will most likely be the loudest component of your robotic system. It
                    is recommended that the air compressor be mounted AWAY from your control system board, near the
                    tanks, and done so securely. The vibrations can loosen a standard nut from a bolt, as such, systems
                    mounted near the air compressor using a bolt & nut should utilize lock nuts and lock washers.

        <h2>Motor Controllers</h2>
        <img src="images/speedcontrollers.jpg">
        <p class="wpilibSummary">
            There are a variety of different motor controllers which work with the FRC Control System and are approved
            for use. These devices are used to provide variable voltage control of the brushed DC motors used in FRC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Motor Controllers is a generic category that covers both speed controllers and relays provided/supported by
            FRC. Depending on your team and kit composition, you may utilize different combinations of motor
            controllers. For this reason, I'll try to cover motor controllers from a general sense, since they're all
            pretty similar at the end of the day.

            <p>
                A simple, electrically operated but mechanical in nature switch. Relays are often used to control power
                to a system, where the control signal is a separate and significantly less powerful.
                <br>
                The most popular relay uses an electromagnet to mechanically operate the switch. During operation,
                relays of this nature feature physically moving parts, and as such, emit 'clicks' when switched.
                <br>
                Unlike speed controllers, relays tend to be physically smaller, but require a fuse of their own. They
                are also cheaper.

            <h4>So, where do you use relays in your robotics system?</h4>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the motor(s) driven only need to move forwards/backwards with minimal/no regulation on speed. For
                    example, a small motor driving a belt feed. The speed is irrelevant, as long as the fed item gets to
                    the required subsystem. Another example would be a 2-state actuator, where an armature is either
                    closed (retracted), or extended at a fixed-angle.

            <h4>Speed Controllers (ESC)</h4>
            <img src="images/ESC_35A.jpg">
            <small>Generic ESC module</small>
            <p>
                A method of electronic speed control, which can drive a motor at varying speeds in either direction.
                This is done by rapidly switching the power for the motor. Quicker switching, the faster the motor runs,
                and vice-versa.
                <br>
                Some speed controllers utilize technology similar to relays. The majority of speed controllers supported
                by FRC are electronic, using transistors instead of relays. The rapid switching of these transistors is
                what causes the variable duty cycles.
                <br>
            <h4>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</h4>
            Unlike a relay which requires a simple on/off signal, speed controllers (ESC for the purpose of FRC) utilize
            pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals. Really, PWM is a fancy term for digital signals featuring duty cycles,
            where the variance of 'on time' (HIGH) evaluates to the time when the motor receives power. These duty cycle
            signals are sent to a speed controller in pulses.
            <br>
            PWM is popular for servos, (usually) small precise motors meant for precise motion.
            Popular speed controllers supported by FRC would be the Talon, Jaguar, and Victor series'.
            <br>
            <h4>Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)</h4>
            With a little more effort, I suggest teams take a look at PID (proportional-integral-derivative)
            Controllers. PID technology is used for controlling and tracking kinematic systems where precision is key.
            <br>
            Think about it; all this time, we are driving a motor with some signal, telling it to run for X amount of
            time, at Y percentage. But, how do we ensure that the motor actually went that distance, or ran at that
            speed?
            <br>
            PID is a MUST for autonomous. With PID, the microcontroller retrieves feedback from that specific system,
            which it can then use to correct any errors. For instance, if the system expects 15 revolutions, but only
            performed 10 after X duty cycles, then the system can perform extra duty cycles until it reaches the
            required revolutions, automatically, without user input.

                    Your drive train! You (hopefully) want to control the speed in which your robot moves forwards and
                    backwards.

            With so many teams using different camera technology, I won't dwell into this much. However, cameras are
            encouraged for teams, with professional teams utilizing multiple to get the best view of the field from
            their stations. A list of FRC-standard cameras can be found on the WPILib control system documentation page.

            Less of a control system element and more of a means of communication. For that reason, it has been excluded
            from this guide. However, there is a plethora of information regarding how the radio works, as well as the
            communication between the roboRIO, radio, and control station on WPILib.
